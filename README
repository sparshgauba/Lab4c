LAB 4B README

lab4c_tcp.c
    This file contains the implementation for part one of
    the lab. It uses the mraa library functions to read
    raw input from the temperature sensor as well as the
    digital state of the button attached to the GPIO
    connection. Sends data to the TCP server. 

Makefile
    Contains the default target for compiling the code as
    well as clean to remove unnecessary files and a dist
    target to create a distributable zip file.
