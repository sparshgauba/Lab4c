LAB 4B README

lab4b.c
    This file contains the implementation for the lab. It 
    uses the mraa library functions to read raw input from
    the temperature sensor as well as the digital state
    of the button attached to the GPIO connection. Using
    a continuous while loop, it prints out the time stamp
    using time.h library and the corresponding temperature
    reading. Using a separate thread, it keeps a check on 
    the value of the button, and if pressed, breaks out of
    the main continuous loop and exits after printing out 
    the last temperature reading. Lastly, another thread
    utilizes the poll() function in order to detect an
    input from the user via STDIN and parses the input for 
    commands, and takes appropriate actions based on the 
    commands.

Makefile
    Contains the default target for compiling the code as
    well as clean to remove unnecessary files and a dist
    target to create a distributable zip file.
